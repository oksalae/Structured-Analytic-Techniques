# Timeline for Structured Analytic Techniques

A lightweight, browser-based timeline tool for **Structured Analytic Techniques (SAT)**. Use it to capture events with context (what/why/who/where), attach sources, and analyze patterns over time using zoom, filtering, and a clean event-detail workflow. Runs fully in the browser (no backend required) and works offline.

## What it does

- Create timestamped events (**name, description, source, date, time**)
- Visualize events on a time axis with connectors and numbered dots
- Alternate event placement the timeline to improve readability
- Click events to open a dedicated **Event Details** panel
- Use a **scale range** to focus on a specific time window
- Zoom in/out to support analysis at different levels of detail
- Manage UI panels from **Layouts** (show/hide + reset layouts)
- Import/export events as **JSON** from **File**

---

## Quick start

### Run locally
This is a static web app.

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in a browser  
   *(recommended: run a local server for best results)*

Example local server:
- VS Code: “Live Server” extension  
- Or any simple HTTP server (e.g. Python, Node)

### Use on GitHub Pages
Enable GitHub Pages from the repo settings and point it to `/ (root)` or `/docs` depending on your setup.

## How to use

### 1) Create events
Open **Create New Event** and add:
- **Name** (short, clear headline)
- **Description** (brief who/what/where/when/why)
- **Source** (URL)
- **Date** and **Time**

Click **Add event**.

### 2) Navigate and analyze
- Use the **Scale range** inputs to set a date window and click **Apply**
- Use the **brush/slider** to refine the visible range
- Use **Zoom** to analyze dense clusters or the big picture
- Click an event dot/box (or the item in **Events**) to open **Event Details**

### 3) Panels / layout
Use **Layouts** to toggle:
- Show Create New Event
- Show Events
- Show Event Details
- Reset layouts

### 4) Import / export / wipe
Use **File** to:
- **Import Events** (JSON)
- **Export Events** (JSON)
- **Download JSON Template**
- **Remove all Events** (start from a blank timeline)

## Data storage

Events are saved in your browser using **localStorage** by default.  
This means:
- No server or database is required
- Your events stay on the same browser/device unless exported
- Use **File → Export Events** to share or version your dataset

---

## JSON format (import/export)

The import/export uses an **array** of event objects with:

- `name` (string)
- `description` (string)
- `source` (string URL)
- `date` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `time` (HH:MM)

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "North Korea launched ballistic missiles",
    "description": "Reports said multiple ballistic missiles were fired toward the sea off the DPRK east coast, drawing condemnation and underscoring continued weapons testing.",
    "source": "https://www.reuters.com",
    "date": "2026-01-27",
    "time": "15:50"
  }
]
