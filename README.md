# Structured Analytic Techniques

A collection of lightweight, analyst-focused tools supporting Structured Analytic Techniques (SAT).  
All tools run client-side, require no backend, and work offline where applicable.

## Purpose

These tools integrate Structured Analytic Techniques (SAT) into practical, lightweight workflows.  
The aim is to externalize analytic thinking—making assumptions, relationships, and timelines explicit—while reducing cognitive bias and improving transparency. The tools support exploratory analysis in complex and uncertain problem spaces without imposing heavy frameworks or infrastructure.
