# Causal Map for Structured Analytic Techniques (SAT)

A lightweight, browser-based **causal map / concept-map editor** for Structured Analytic Techniques (SAT).  
It renders a hierarchical JSON dataset as an interactive node-link graph (SVG), supports node creation, editing, and annotation, and runs entirely in the browser with no backend required.

Runs offline, stores data in the browser during the session, and allows import/export of datasets as JSON.

## 🔍 What it does

- Visualizes a **tree-structured JSON** dataset as an interactive causal/concept map
- Allows **adding sub-nodes** under any node using the “+” button
- Supports **editing nodes** (rename, recolor, delete)
- Provides a **comment popup** for each node (💬 icon):
  - **Description** — free-text contextual note
  - **Source** — URL or reference
- Offers smooth **pan & zoom** navigation + “Center View”
- Includes **Float mode** — a force-directed physics simulation for exploration
- Lets you **Import JSON** and **Export JSON** through the File menu
- Runs entirely client-side; no server or dependencies

## 🚀 Quick start

**From repo root:** Run `node start-all.js` and open the hub at http://localhost:3000, then click **Causal Map** (port 8765).

### Option 1: Open directly  
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

### Option 2: Serve locally (recommended)  
Some browsers limit features over `file://`. To avoid issues:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:  
👉 http://localhost:8000

### Option 3: Auto-save indicators to the circleboarding folder  
To have **Create Indicators** write directly to  
`Structured-Analytic-Techniques/structured-analytic-circleboarding/indicators.txt`  
without any save dialog, run the included Node.js server from this folder:

```bash
cd structured-analytic-causal-map
node server.js
```

Then open:  
👉 http://localhost:8765  

When you click **Create Indicators**, the file is written automatically (no prompt).  
If you open the app without the server (e.g. by double-clicking `index.html`), the app will fall back to a download or save dialog.

## 💾 Data storage

- All map data is stored temporarily using **sessionStorage**
- There is **no backend or database**
- Data persists only for the browser session
- Use **File → Save (Export)** to store or share your dataset as JSON

## 📦 JSON format (import/export)

The app loads and saves a **hierarchical node tree** with:

| Field         | Type   | Required | Notes |
|--------------|--------|----------|-------|
| `id`         | string | Yes      | Unique identifier |
| `label`      | string | Yes      | Node name |
| `children`   | array  | Yes      | Child nodes |
| `description`| string | No       | Shown in comment popup |
| `source`     | string | No       | URL or reference |
| `color`      | string | No       | Hex color for node box |
| `x`, `y`     | number | No       | Stored positions |

### Example (excerpt)

```json
{
  "id": "iran",
  "label": "Iran",
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "iran-diplomatic",
      "label": "Diplomatic",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "iran-diplomatic-bilateral-major-powers-china",
          "label": "China",
          "description": "Maintains strategic economic and diplomatic ties, including energy trade and infrastructure cooperation.",
          "source": "https://www.mfa.gov.ir/en",
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
